# Trannoi

![Trannoi](/og-images/projects/trannoi.png)

## The Story

A group of astronauts is traveling aboard the spaceship _Skelt_, and their goal is to complete all the scheduled tasks (the quests) required to keep the ship running, so they can reach their destination safely.

However, hidden among them are impostors, whose objective is to secretly eliminate the crew members without being discovered.

Will the astronauts manage to complete their mission before being wiped out?

**Trannoi** is loosely inspired by an existing <a href="https://github.com/Cassio7/Trannoi" target="_blank">game</a>.

## Compilation Instructions

Clone the repository available on <a href="YOUR_REPO_LINK_HERE" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and compile both files: `main.c` and `gamelib.c` separately using the following commands:

```bash
gcc -c main.c      # generates main.o
gcc -c gamelib.c   # generates gamelib.o
```

Now Link the object files to create the final executable:

```bash
gcc -o trannoi main.o gamelib.o
```

After compilation, you can run the program with:

```bash
./trannoi
```

Now just **enjoy** your mission!
