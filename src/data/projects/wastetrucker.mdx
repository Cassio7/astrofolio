# WasteTrucker

## Introductions

**WasteTrucker** is an advanced monitoring system designed to provide real-time visibility into company vehicle activity and to ensure the correct functioning of RFID readers and antenna infrastructure.

## Main Goal

The main goal of the application is to monitor and detect anomalies in vehicle operations. Specifically, it performs three types of checks:

- **GPS**  
  Detects GPS malfunctions or incorrect behavior, where the reported vehicle position does not match the actual location.

- **Antenna**  
  Identifies issues with the onboard device responsible for reading tags applied to containers, indicating a possible hardware malfunction.

- **Session**  
  Verifies whether the last recorded and saved event on the vehicle corresponds to the actual closure of its most recent session.
