# The Birth of MaseMagna

One day, my group of friends and I were invited to a birthday party. Everyone was curious about where, when, and at what time it would take place—but only one guy asked, **“ma se magna?”**

In the dialect where I come from, it literally means, _“but do we eat?”_. The timing and the way he said it made everyone laugh, and it quickly became one of the many meme-worthy phrases within our group. From that day on, every time we went somewhere, the question was always the same.

Then we had an idea: why not actually visit different places—restaurants, trattorias, fast-food joints, and more—to see how the food really is, evaluating both the food and the experience, and writing a review?  
Turning a joke into something tangible that could become a memory for us, but at the same time leave a trace and a guide for others.

And that’s how **MaseMagna** was born—a place to collect reviews of places where you can eat, have fun, and feel good. Our goal is to promote real food, the kind made with passion, love, and hard work. That’s why MaseMagna will never recommend “food porn” spots, overly “Instagrammable” locations, or places created solely for profit.  
Most posts will be written by us. We are not culinary experts, nor do we claim to be; we are simply sharing our own experiences.

Right now, I’m developing the website. At the moment, it’s a one-man army situation on the coding side, and balancing it with work isn’t easy, but I’m carving out space to get everything done little by little.  
In the future, I’d like to create a social media section to post videos and introduce the world to our idea and project.  
Sure, I know there are plenty of food bloggers and reviewers out there, but it often seems like everything is fake, staged, or sponsored. True reviews seem rare—it’s all promotion.

So, why MaseMagna? Because we want to bring back the joy of eating, the excitement of discovering a great dish, and the simple pleasure of sharing an honest experience. Join us on this journey, laugh with us, and maybe even find your next favorite place to eat.
Who knows—maybe one day people will start saying **“ma se magna”** even outside of Perugia!
